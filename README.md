# Wikipedia Search Engine

This project is a simple search engine for Wikipedia articles. It utilizes the debounce technique to improve the user experience by delaying the search execution until the user stops typing, reducing unnecessary API requests.


## Contribution

In this project, I played a key role in implementing the debounce functionality for the search engine. The debounce technique was applied to the search input, allowing for a smoother user experience by reducing unnecessary API requests.


## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can use the search input at the top of the page to search for Wikipedia articles. The debounce technique ensures that the search execution is delayed until you stop typing, providing a smoother and more efficient search experience.
